remove(x): Removes x. However, this only works if x is a file, or an EMPTY
	directory.

Assume that it's possible to iterate over all of the "things" in a directory
d

my_folder
	my_other_folder
		my_file

remove_all(d):
	for each thing x within d:
		if x is a nonempty directory:
			remove_all(x) // recursive call
		else:
			remove(x)
	remove(d)
